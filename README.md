# Computational Theory Notebook - G00411941

This is a Python notebook for my Computational Theory module. It works through 8 tasks related to computational problems relevant in cryptography. Each task is explained and contextualized. The solution's for each task is supplmented by a markdown explanation, comments, and tests designed to verify its functionality and demonstrate its purpose. Sources can be found throughout the notebook, which explain and justify the choices behind each solution.

**Note:** To run the complete notebook, a `dictionary.txt` file containing an English dictionary should be added to the project.
